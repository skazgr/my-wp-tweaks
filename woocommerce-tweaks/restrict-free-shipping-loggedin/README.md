# Restrict Free Shipping to Logged-in Users Only

This snippet disables the WooCommerce "Free Shipping" method for guests.
Only logged-in users will see free shipping as an option at checkout.

## Usage

Copy the PHP code to your theme's `functions.php` or include the snippet as a mini-plugin.

## Expected Behavior

- Guests (not logged in) will not see "Free Shipping" during checkout.
- Logged-in users will see all available shipping methods including free shipping.
